To set up an interactive Python environment with `tmux` and automatically start it upon launching `tmux`, you can follow these steps:

### 1. **Install tmux**
   If you haven't installed `tmux` yet, you can do so using Homebrew:

   ```bash
   brew install tmux
   ```

### 2. **Create a tmux Configuration File**
   You can create or edit your `~/.tmux.conf` file to set up custom configurations.

   Open `~/.tmux.conf`:

   ```bash
   nano ~/.tmux.conf
   ```

   Add the following configuration to automatically open a Python REPL in the first window:

   ```bash
   # Start a new session with a Python REPL
   new-session -d -s python_session 'python3'
   attach-session -t python_session
   ```

   This configuration will create a new tmux session named `python_session` and automatically start a Python REPL.

   Save and exit the file by pressing `CTRL + O` (then press Enter to confirm), and then `CTRL + X` to exit.

### 3. **Launching tmux with Python**
   Now, whenever you start tmux, it will open an interactive Python session.

   Just run:

   ```bash
   tmux
   ```

   Youâ€™ll be taken directly into an interactive Python shell within `tmux`.

### 4. **Adding to `.zshrc` (Optional)**
   If you want `tmux` with an interactive Python session to start automatically every time you open a terminal, you can add it to your `.zshrc`:

   ```bash
   echo "tmux new-session -A -s python_session" >> ~/.zshrc
   ```

   This line will start `tmux` with the Python session whenever you open a terminal. If the session already exists, it will attach to it; otherwise, it will create a new one.
